## Financial Metrics Calculated

### 1. **Effective Gross Income (EGI)**
**Formula**: `Gross Income - Vacancy`

The total income after accounting for vacancy losses.

### 2. **Net Operating Income (NOI)**
**Formula**: `EGI - Operating Expenses`

Income after all operating expenses, but before debt service.
**Note**: Operating Expenses do NOT include Debt Service (mortgage payments).

### 3. **Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)**
**Formula**: `(NOI / Purchase Price) × 100`

Measures the property's potential return on investment.
**Note**: If you buy cash, Cap Rate = Cash on Cash ROI

### 4. **Cash Flow Before Tax (CFBT)**
**Formula**: `NOI - Debt Service - CAPEX`

The actual cash flow generated by the property before taxes.

### 5. **Cash on Cash ROI (COC)**
**Formula**: `(CFBT / Down Payment) × 100`

Return on the actual cash invested (down payment).
**Note**: If you buy cash, Cap Rate = COC

### 6. **Debt Coverage Ratio (DCR)**
**Formula**: `NOI / Debt Service (P+I)`

Measures the property's ability to cover debt payments.
- **DCR > 1.25**: Generally preferred by lenders
- **DCR = 1.0**: Property breaks even on debt service
- **DCR < 1.0**: Property cannot cover debt payments

### 7. **Operating Expenses Ratio (OER)**
**Formula**: `(Operating Expenses / Gross Operating Income) × 100`

Percentage of income consumed by operating expenses.

### 8. **Rent to Value Ratio (R/V)**
**Formula**: `(Gross Monthly Rental Income / Current Market Value) × 100`

Quick measure of property's cash-flow potential.
- **Ideal Range**: 0.8% - 1.0%
- **Example**: $2,600 rent / $270,000 value = 0.96%

### 9. **Loan to Value (LTV)**
**Formula**: `(Loan / Purchase Price) × 100`

Percentage of property value financed.
- **Higher LTV** = Higher bank risk
- **Lower LTV** = Lower bank risk

### 10. **Equity / Appreciation**
**Formula**: `Market Value - Loan Balance`

Current equity in the property.
